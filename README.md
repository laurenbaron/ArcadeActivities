# ArcadeActivities
A collection of simple activities to practice using Arcade. The "ada or potato" game is where you score a point if you click Ada the Corgi and lose a point if you click the potato. The "red dot" game is where the red dots on the screen multiply when a dot collides with your cursor. There are other files that helpe introduce me to using dictionaries and Arcade.
